# What are NFTs?

NFTs (Non-fungible tokens) have taken the world by storm, hitting $25 billion dollar sales in 2021. So what are NFTs and which problems do they solve?
 
Before we explore these questions, we need to look at the double-spend problem. Prior to Bitcoin's blockchain, it was challenging to figure out how to prevent someone from copying and pasting a digital dollar or any digital asset, like an MP3 or a digital piece of artwork. If you were to buy a digital piece of artwork, there was no straightforward way to identify that the artwork was a one-of-one collection and that you were the sole owner of it.

The blockchain solved this problem by verifying every transaction and making transactions irreversible and immutable, but it still didn't solve the "fungible" aspect of digital ownership. This means, that while you can own Bitcoin, the qualities and properties of your Bitcoin are the same as every other person's Bitcoin. We'll come back to how this was solved on Ethereum, but first, we need to talk about ERC-20 tokens.

The Ethereum blockchain allowed smart contracts (think of this as a contract written in code), which then gave rise to the ability for anyone to launch their own cryptocurrency on top of the Ethereum blockchain, via the [ERC-20 Token](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) standard. Introduced in 2015, the ERC-20 standard provided a set of standardized rules for how tokens should be created on top of Ethereum, but these tokens were still fungible, meaning noting distinguished my Dogecoin from yours.

Meet the ERC-721 standard, which was launched in 2017. This standard allows the creation of "non-fungible" tokens, meaning there can only be a one-of-a-kind version of a token, with a unique set of properties and attributes. Let's take, for instance, we're creating an NFT of a video game character. Its metadata can include the URL to where the JPEG file of the character is stored, the name, any special attributes, and properties like how many lives this character has, if the character can only use certain items in the game, etc. Cryptokittens was one of the early projects to adopt the standard for their virtual cats.


In 2022 another standard was introduced by the Azuki Development Team, called [ERC-721A]([url](https://www.azuki.com/erc721a)), which allows you to batch a collection of NFTs and save on gas fees.



| Standards | Use Case                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ERC-20    | Used for fungible tokens like cryptocurrencies, where there can be many of the same tokens, that share the same attributes.                                                                            |
| ERC-721   | Mint none-fungible tokens like digital artwork, items that require proof of ownership or are one-of-one.                                                                                               |
| ERC-721A  | Batch mint a collection of non-fungible tokens to save on gas fees.                                                                                                                                    |
| ERC-721R  | This [standard]([url](https://erc721r.org/)) is fairly new and allows the ability for NFT purchasers to ask for a refund that includes the cost of minting within a certain time period.               |
| ERC-1155  | A way to batch both fungible and non-fungible tokens together in the same contract. Think of a video game where there's a token as well as characters, that can be bought as an NFT with those tokens. |


It's a common misconception that NFTs can only be JPEGs, they can be any digital file you attach to them, and they can even be paired with real-world objects. In fact, the NFT standard just holds the metadata with properties and attributes of a collection on the blockchain or "on-chain". So what is commonly referred to as an "NFT", is really just an item's metadata stored on the blockchain, following the ERC-721 standard that ensures that the item is unique. This metadata can have different combinations that can be used to generate new characters on the fly to form an entire collection.

Many of these JPEGs are stored on third-party decentralized file services like Arweave, Threefold, IPFS via gateways like Pinata, and even centralized services like Amazon Web Services (AWS). We will get into the storage aspects of NFTs in the upcoming lessons.  The best way to understand ERC is by diving into the code. Let's look at a [sample of an ERC-721 token smart](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721) contract, using the OpenZepplin library that is used to create unique items for video game players. 
 
**Note**: This lesson presupposes you've completed the Ethereum 101 Course or know the basics of smart contracts, working with Ethers.js, and know another coding language like JavaScript. This example is a high-level overview of the ERC-721 smart contract, in future lessons, we will go more in-depth.


```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Full.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/drafts/Counters.sol";

contract GameItem is ERC721Full {

    using Counters for Counters.Counter;
    Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;

    constructor() ERC721Full("GameItem", "ITM") public {}

    function awardItem(address player, string memory tokenURI) public returns (uint256) {
        _tokenIds.increment();

        uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds.current();
        _mint(player, newItemId);
        _setTokenURI(newItemId, tokenURI);

        return newItemId;
    }
}
```



```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Full.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/drafts/Counters.sol";
```

Here we're defining the version of solidity we're using. Then we're importing in OpenZeppelin's implementation of the ERC-721 standard, which comes with some handy functions like checking who the owner of an NFT is and minting the NFTs.

```solidity
contract GameItem is ERC721Full {
    using Counters for Counters.Counter;
    Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;

    constructor() ERC721Full("GameItem", "ITM") public {}

    function awardItem(address player, string memory tokenURI) public returns (uint256) {
        _tokenIds.increment();

        uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds.current();
        _mint(player, newItemId);
        _setTokenURI(newItemId, tokenURI);

        return newItemId;
    }
}
```

On **line 1**, we name our contract GameItem and inherit the ERC721 library from OpenZepplin. On **line 2** we're inheriting all the methods from the [Counter library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Counters.sol) and **line 3** we're inheriting Counter, which is of type struct and has a default value of 0 that is of type int. This can seem confusing, but to clear things up take a look at this [line](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Counters.sol#L15) from the Counters contract. We're then storing 0 in a private variable called "_tokenIds", as you can tell from the underscore at the start of this variable, and using it as a function parameter.

On **line 5**, we're giving our token the name "GameItem" with the symbol "ITM".  On **line 7** we're using the **awardItem**() function, which takes in the wallet address of the player, and a tokenURI. Think of tokenURI as a unique identifier for our NFT metadata, that we can reference to check and include things like a link to our JPEG file, which typically would be a JSON file. On **line 8** our tokenIds are incremented and **online 10** assigned to the variable **newItemID**.

We then call the mint function **online 11** to create the NFT and assign it to the player. This costs a gas fee and is the point where the NFT is actually created. We then assign the tokenURI to the item ID with [**setTokenURI**](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721-_setTokenURI-uint256-string-) to ensure that our that item is one of a kind, and finally we return the new item.

Let's look at what happens when we call this contract:

```bash
> gameItem.awardItem(playerAddress, "https://game.example/item-id-8u5h2m.json")
Transaction successful. Transaction hash: 0x...
Events emitted:
 - Transfer(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000, playerAddress, 7)
```

The player gets an NFT with an ID of 7 that includes the metadata from the JSON file (https://game.example/item-id-8u5h2m.json). We can prove this by running the ownerOf function that comes with our OpenZepplin contracts:

```bash
> gameItem.ownerOf(7)
playerAddress
> gameItem.tokenURI(7)
"https://game.example/item-id-8u5h2m.json"
```

Let's look at the metadata of what actually is in the JSON file:

```json
{
    "name": "Thor's hammer",
    "description": "MjÃ¶lnir, the legendary hammer of the Norse god of thunder.",
    "image": "https://game.example/item-id-8u5h2m.png",
    "strength": 20
}
```

So is an NFT just metadata in a JSON file, with a unique ID that gets verified on-chain and somehow is valued in hundreds of thousands of dollars ðŸ˜²? Let us know what you think in the discord, or you can tag us on Twitter @cadenadev ðŸ¤”
